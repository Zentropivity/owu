## The World

moves on...  
Humans are no longer part of it, are they? I wonder what happened to them...

Yet there is an ecosystem that thrives. Magic is in the core of it all.

## Core mechanics

- Souls: every living being has one
  - don't let yours get captured...
- Frames: every living being should have one...
  - may be swapped with the right knowledge...
- Skills: may be found/crafted/learned/acquired out there
  - from your basic abilities to your fanciest magics
- Sandbox: the world is yours to shape too, do mind other inhabitants though
- Physics based: I want it to be reasonably physically accurate while fast

## Factions

They exist in the world and players may interact with them, one of them is chosen at start for Frame.

- [Cyber](./factions/cyber.md) - robot; crafty
- [Blob](./factions/blob.md) - slime; hungry
- [Wyvern](./factions/wyvern.md) - lizard, dragon; wise
