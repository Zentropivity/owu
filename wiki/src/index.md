## The World

moves on...  
Humans are no longer part of it, are they?

Yet there is an ecosystem that thrives. Magic has shaped the world.

## Core Mechanics

- Souls: everyone from a Tribe has one
  - don't let yours get captured...
- Frames: every living being should have at least one...
  - may be swapped with the right knowledge, you will be able to store more of them
- Skills: may be found/crafted/learned/acquired out there
  - from basic abilities to the fanciest of magics
- Sandbox: the world is yours to shape too, do mind other inhabitants though
- Physics based: I want it to be reasonably physically accurate while fast

### Tribes

The groups of intelligent beings that exist in the world. Players may interact with them, one of them is chosen for starting Frame.

- [Cyber](./tribes/cyber.md) - robot; crafty
- [Blob](./tribes/blob.md) - slime; hungry
- [Dragon](./tribes/dragon.md) - magical winged lizard; wise
