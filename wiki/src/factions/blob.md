# Blob

Developed during the Last War as a biological weapon to consume foes.  
Having been given souls, they achieved mastery of alchemy. In their new form they resemble fantastical monsters: slimes. They do not rely on magic.

## Gameplay

Omnivores, sustaining damage may make you lose body matter that you regain by eating.

### Extremely resilient

- can touch and carry hazardous materials without issues
- can restore lost matter by consuming biological matter
- eating more and more may increase their size temporarily, boosting abilities
    but this is not stable as one soul cannot control more than a fixed amount of Blob matter
  - TODO? maybe make it possible to combine into one bigger, stable Blob with other players ?
- only weak point is the soul which floats around inside the blob

Blob matter cannot be stored in the inventory under normal circumstances so Blob players may want to keep biological materials around for restoration purposes.

### Alchemical expert

- can decompose materials or combine them to make new ones
- consuming materials gives them temporary skills, for example:
  - eat a rock => can materialize outer shell as rock, throw rock
  - rubber => become bouncy
- they are the most precise builders as they can arrange materials in any shapes they want

### Shape shifter

They may take up various shapes:

- squishy ball: their base shape, most comfortable, versatile
- emotes, for example:
  - turn into an arrow pointing in a specific direction
- imitation of something already seen/enveloped:
  - may even materialize as the thing if you have enough materials in inventory

They also have an unnatural hunger for Human matter...
