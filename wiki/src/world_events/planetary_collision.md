# Planetary Collision

The Core of the planet calls out to you as you face annihilation: a huge object (another planet perhaps?) rapidly approaches your location.

	- Planet calls out to players: good luck!
- They should probably dodge the incoming planet and debris or something, alternatively become part of the crater that will surely be left
