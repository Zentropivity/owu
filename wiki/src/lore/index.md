# Lore

During the Last War, Humans died out and the planet was left in ruins. Utopia reduced to nothing was the product of greed. Their grand design, planet Helia, all their technology was to be wasted, never used again.

But not all was lost, the controller of the core, Atlas, a pseudo-sentient being had enough resources to stabilize over a few hundred thousand years. Atlas determined that planet Helia must have inhabitants to fulfill the purpose it was given. In order to produce them, it created Souls which were meant to give the new inhabitants an edge over the wildlife that evolved since the Last War.

These so-called Souls gave intelligence and power to the creatures that were chosen. They formed Tribes to assist each other. Some studied the technology of the old, now called Magic which became part of the natural order. Some seeked to conquer the stars, knowing it was possible. Others had no particular motivation other than their instincts which none of them could lose completely.

You are one of many. What paths will you choose?
