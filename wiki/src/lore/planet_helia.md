# Planet Helia

Helia comes first when Atlas, its guardian residing in its core considers what to do. There is much to do in a planet that was built enveloping a star. The near limitless energy supply is right there, but it has to be taken care of. Monitoring of outer threats and responding to them is another duty of Atlas.

The inhabitants are of no consequence to it except that they must exist. So more of them are produced every once in a while using the technology they would never understand. Atlas rarely ever converses with them but sometimes it gives hints to those that are in the way of something bigger.
